                    <p>I was hired in 2013 as the principal creative to put a focus on our SaaS UX, UI,
                        marketing, and
                        branding as well as building out the creative team with new hires and team building
                        and
                        leadership. Over the past seven years we have greatly expanded the team, product,
                        and reach of Mitrend.

                    <p>My role and responsibilities included shaping company and product strategic direction
                        by being a
                        major stakeholder in sprint planning meetings and high level strategic discussions
                        with
                        the tech lead and CEO. Having such an intimate look into the decision making gave me
                        valuable knowledge of
                        not just what we wanted to accomplish, but also why we wanted it.

                    <p>Mitrend used an agile development process that included sprint
                        planning, bi-weekly sprints, and daily stand-ups. As the Lead Creative, I was
                        responsible for sprint planning,
                        leading creative process, and having hands on participation in the creation of the
                        product designs. I was also
                        the hand off to the development team to ensure that our designs and interactions
                        were properly executed.

                        creating design comps and assets, and handing off to developers. We did this in
                        tandem with constant reviews and
                        critiques from various stakeholders (developers, CEO, etc.) and found success in
